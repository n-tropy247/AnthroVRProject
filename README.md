# AnthroVRProject
This is a simple VR application built for the Oculus Quest to showcase virtual environments using the WRLD3D SDK for Unity.

This project took about 40 hours from start to finish; I've never developed for VR before and had a lot of issues along the way.

This is my final project for Anthropology 3623 at OSU.

See the Wiki for download instructions.
